      **_<details closed><summary>Unit Tests</summary>_**
      
      Reasons for local unit test execution:
      - Unit tests might pass locally but not in the CI environment during the status check process or vice-versa.
      - Tests might pass on the developer's machine but not necessarily on the code reviewer's machine.
